//Description: Write a C program to take current date (day, month, and year) as input and determine the next date. You should take three integers as inputs â€“ day, month, and year. 

//Sample input (current date)             Sample output (next date)              Explanation
//Day: 12   Month: 12  Year: 2022         Day: 13   Month: 12  Year: 2022        Just increment the day variable by 1 as the day is not the last day of the month.
//Day: 30   Month: 11  Year: 2022         Day: 1   Month: 12  Year: 2022         Increment the month variable by 1 and set the day variable to 1 as the input was the last date of the month.
//Day: 31   Month: 12  Year: 2022         Day: 1   Month: 1  Year: 2023          As the date is the last date of the year, the day and month variables are set to 1 and the year is incremented by 1
//Day: 28   Month: 2   Year: 2023         Day: 1   Month: 3  Year: 2023          The input was the last date of February in a non-leap year.Therefore, the date is set to the first of the March. 
//Day: 28   Month: 2   Year: 2024         Day: 29   Month: 2  Year: 2024         The input was the 28th of February in a leap year. Therefore, the date is set by only incrementing the day variable by 1.
//Day: 34   Month: 13  Year: 24           Invalid input                          The input date is not valid.
